# AlienSky

## Overview

**AlienSky** is a web application developed for the NASA Space App Challenge 2024. The application visualizes the starmap and provides an interface for users to explore the stars visible from an exoplanet located at the same longitude and latitude as Earth. By simulating the night sky from this unique perspective, users can gain insights into celestial phenomena and the potential for life beyond our planet.

## Features

- Interactive starmap displaying stars visible from the selected exoplanet location.
- Integration with the **Vizier API** for astronomical data.
- Utilization of the **NASA Exoplanet API** to select and retrieve data about various exoplanets.
- User-friendly interface allowing users to select the name of the exoplanet.
- Real-time updates for celestial events.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Python (Flask)
- **APIs**: 
  - Vizier API for astronomical data
  - NASA Exoplanet API for exoplanet information


## Usage

- Select the name of the exoplanet from a dropdown menu to view the starmap for that specific location.
- Explore the interactive interface to learn more about the visible stars and constellations from that exoplanet.


## Acknowledgments

- Special thanks to the **Vizier API** and **NASA Exoplanet API** for providing valuable data for our project.
- Inspiration drawn from the NASA Space App Challenge for promoting innovation and exploration in space science.
